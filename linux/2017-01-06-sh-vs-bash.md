# sh vs. bash

`sh` (or the Shell Command Language) is a programming language described by the POSIX standard. It is a specification and has many implementations (ksh88, dash, ...). 

`bash` started as an `sh`-compatible implementation. `bash` can also be considered an implementation of sh.

**Because sh is a specification, not an implementation, /bin/sh is a symlink (or a hard link) to an actual implementation on most POSIX systems.**
